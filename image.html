            <h2>Image Comics</h2>
            <p>In the early 1990s, several popular Marvel Comics illustrators became angry that artwork and characters they created were being heavily merchandized, with the artists - working as freelancers - receiving only page rates for their work and modest royalties. They also resented a common attitude among Marvel management (also at rival DC Comics) that the writers and artists were less important to the success of a series than the characters, and could easily be replaced.Image's success has significantly changed the position of creators in the comic book industry, but infighting between its partners and their lack of business experience have contributed to sometimes-volatile fortunes for the company.</p>
